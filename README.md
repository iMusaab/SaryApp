# SaryApp


Key information regarding my assignment:

- The first API didnâ€™t return any information, so I took the expected Json response and embedded it in the file and decoded it
locally.
- The second API worked and data were decoded and presented in views. 
- I used MVVM with a manager for the API
- I used Combine instead of RX swift
- For the UI I used SwiftUI

Thank you for taking the time to review my assignment, 

:)
